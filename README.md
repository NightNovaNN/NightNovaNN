# 👋 Hi, I'm NightNova

I'm a 14-year-old developer from India, working to build **ISD (Indie Software Dev) NightNova** — a future dev studio focused on creating efficient tools, languages, and software utilities.

I experiment with:

- programming language design
- compilers & transpilers
- lightweight scripting engines
- CLI tools
- performance-focused utilities

I use AI as a collaborator to accelerate ideas, but all problem-solving, debugging, and architecture decisions come from my own learning and thinking.  
My goal is to understand how systems work under the hood and build tools that feel clean, fast, and modern.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### Languages like Arc

A minimal logic DSL that transpiles into real languages like **C** and **Python**, featuring:

- simple, expressive syntax
- inline native code blocks
- automated type detection
- brace balancing
- multi-backend emitters

This is part of a long-term vision to create developer tools that merge simplicity with real-world power.

### Big langs like Trappist, Lunar, BioC and Cryo
**Cryo** is my experimental language with 0 runtime, Trappist is my actual serious language which i'll push the most, Lunar, BioC and Hypa are mainstream langs of mine but will be deeper in the Studio.

Check their repos for more info! (Trappist, Lunar or Hypa don't yet exist but BioC and Cryo do)

### Utilities

Helper items for devs, like UniFetch, PineShell, ClawPy, and more which boost productivity and dev speed
Also check their repos too!

## 🛠️ Skills & Interests

- Python
- C / C++ basics
- Language design, parsing, ASTs
- Tooling, automation, CLI utilities
- Building small but powerful dev tools

## 🎯 Vision

To grow ISD into a studio that builds:

- programming tools
- automation frameworks
- innovative languages
- open-source utilities

Ultimately, I want to make software development faster, cleaner, and more accessible — especially for young developers who want to understand **how things work under the hood**, not just use them.
