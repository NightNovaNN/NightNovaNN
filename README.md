# 👋 Hi, I’m NightNova

I’m a **14-year-old developer from India**, building toward **ISD (Indie Software Dev) NightNova** — a future dev studio focused on creating **efficient tools, programming languages, and system-level utilities**.

I enjoy working close to the metal and understanding **how software actually works under the hood**, not just using abstractions.

---

## 🧪 What I Experiment With

- Programming language design
- Compilers & transpilers
- Lightweight scripting engines
- CLI tools
- Performance-focused utilities

I use AI as a **collaborator** to accelerate ideas, but all **architecture, debugging, and problem-solving decisions come from my own learning and thinking**.

---

## 🧠 Languages & Tech I Use

I’m not a master of everything, but I actively learn and build with:

- **Python** – Intermediate++
- **C / C++** – Beginner → Intermediate
- **Assembly (x86-64, Windows NASM)** – Learning phase
- **Java** – Very basic
- **HTML / CSS** – Strong frontend experience

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

### 🧩 Arc
A minimal **logic DSL** that transpiles into real languages like **C and Python**, featuring:

- Simple, expressive syntax  
- Inline native code blocks  
- Automated type detection  
- Brace balancing  
- Multi-backend emitters  

Arc is part of a long-term vision to build tools that **merge simplicity with real-world power**.

### 🧬 Bigger Language Projects

I’m designing multiple experimental and serious languages under the ISD vision:

- **Cryo** – Experimental language with **zero runtime**
- **Trappist** – My most serious language project (main focus)
- **Lunar, BioC, Hypa** – More mainstream language ideas
- **Lacertae** – Planned flagship language

> Some of these don’t exist publicly yet — **BioC and Cryo do**, the others will come later.

## 🛠️ Utilities & Tools

I also build small tools to boost productivity and dev speed, such as:

- UniFetch  
- PineShell  
- ClawPy  
- and more…

Check their repositories for details.

## 🎯 Vision

To grow **ISD NightNova** into a studio that builds:

- Programming tools  
- Automation frameworks  
- Innovative languages  
- Open-source utilities  

My goal is to make **software development faster, cleaner, and more accessible**, especially for **young developers** who want to understand systems deeply — not just use them.
